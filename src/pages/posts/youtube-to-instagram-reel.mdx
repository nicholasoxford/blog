After installing [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) you can run the following command to download a youtube video and convert it to an instagram reel.

```bash
yt-dlp -o ski.webm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKnz65lTHPM&ab_channel=RedBullSnow
```

and then

```bash
ffmpeg -i ski.webm -ss 00:01:25 -to 00:02:30 -filter_complex "[0:v]crop=1080:1920:(iw-1080)/2:(ih-1920)/2[v]" -map "[v]" -map "0:a?" -c:v libx264 -c:a copy output.mp4
```

The first command, yt-dlp, is a modern and updated version of `youtube-dl`. You suppodely can do features like grab specific timestamps of the a youtube video, but I also read it can take longer than just downloading the whole video. I tried to use youtube-dl but it was downloading videos painfully slow.

The second command is your typical ffmpeg command. We are taking an input: 
```bash
-i ski.webm
```
 and then we are specifying a start time: 
```bash
-ss 00:01:25
``` 
 and an end time: 
 ```bash
 -to 00:02:30
 ```
  We are then cropping the video to be 1080x1920: 
  ```bash
  -filter_complex "[0:v]crop=1080:1920:(iw-1080)/2:(ih-1920)/2[v]"
  ```
  . We are then mapping the video and audio: 
  ```bash
  -map "[v]" -map "0:a?"
  ```
   We are then specifying the video codec: 
   ```bash
   -c:v libx264
   ``` 
   and the audio codec: 
   ```bash
   -c:a copy
   ```
   And finally we are specifying the output file: 
   ```bash
   output.mp4
   ```
