Currently, large social media companies are behemoths that show little sign of slowing down. They own our social graphs, and companies like Meta, Snap, and X have 
no problem expressing this power [1]. This makes sense for them, it is in their best interst to cut off graph access to any company that they percieve 
as competition. From the user perspective, this means if you go to a new social app, you often are starting from scratch. In turn, young social apps will ask for access to your contact
list and incentvise you to invite your friends. We all feel a certain amount of discomfert handing over our contact list to an app you just started using,
however the never ending rat race to grow our following and social brand overcomes any hesitation we have. 

<br/>
    
The only long term answer to these problems are ***fully*** decentralized social graphs that are not ephermal and exist on an layer 1. These social graphs should be easily accesible, composable, and they should
outlive any one company. While Ethereum has led the way with crypto based social apps, the high fees and low TPS have caused a myriad of different interesting and innovative solutons to circumvent 
these issues. They say it is not cost effective or performant to store the way we are all intereconnected actually on chain. Unfortunately for them the path to decentralizaation is innevitable and all protocols will eventually 
be beaten out by one that is cheapest and fully decentralized. I think some people in the Web3 world just dont understand how much friction and mental overhead having to switch from an L1 to L2 can introduce. 
People want things to just work, and the fact that base Solana can replace so many required SaaS companies for building Web2

## The future of social apps

When I look into the future, and try to predict what the social media landscape will look like, I think it will be filled with companies like BeReal and Clubhouse.

On the developer side, growing monthly active users is do or die. You must use every lever you can to get people into your app and make it interesting enough that they decide to come back. To me,
the best thing you can do for retention is show the user interesting content.

There is a lot of talk these days about super apps

## Why higher fees and the censorship are not the answers
