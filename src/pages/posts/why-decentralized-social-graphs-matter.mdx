Currently, large social media companies are behemoths that show little sign of slowing down. They own our social graphs, and companies like Meta, Snap, and X have 
no problem expressing this power [1]. This makes sense for them, it is in their best interst to cut off graph access to any company that they percieve 
as competition. On the user SitemapBuilder, this means if you go to a new social app a lot fo time you are starting from scratch. In turn to grow many apps 
will ask for access to your contact list and incentvise you to invite your friends. 

When I look into the future, and try to predict what the social media landscape will look like, I think it will be filled with companies like BeReal and Clubhouse. 


There is a lot of talk these days about super apps
