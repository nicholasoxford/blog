Inbetween FTX getting shut down and now, not a lot of people were buying crypto. If anything most people were selling their stakes, or willfully forgetting about them. 

But the sun rose again, and today is a new day. People are getting back into crypto, for better or for worse, and I can feel FOMO flowing.

When I went to go buy some Stacks ([STX](https://www.coinbase.com/price/stacks)), I was immediately hit with the old mindfield of crypto buying options. Horrors of yesteryear of sketcky websites asking for a lot of personal info came flowing back, and honestly, I used to just buy everything on FTX.

But now that FTX is gone, I had to find a new way to buy crypto. So I did some research, and here's what I found.

## Coinbase is king 

Coinbase has been around the block, and they have gone head to head with regulators. I honestly feel like `crypto native` users ignored them in the last bull run. That was probably just my idiotic butt. 

However, when I went on their platform to buy some STX, I was pleasantly surprised.

## Steps to buy crypto on Coinbase

1. Create an account
2. Verify your identity
3. Add a payment method
- Bank Account, Debit Card, Paypal, Direct Deposit, Wire Transfer, or Gift Card
4. Buy your crypto

This process had me remanencent of the old FTX days, hopefully without the backdoor to the founders hedge fund.
