## Introducing Cloudflare Workers

This tutorial will largerly follow my [Cloudflare Workers Mindmap](https://excalidraw.com/#json=ZZgKmnqPdbXtVHfqTsiOr,0ZN7WYMFSC5lOu7Bv9m7Pw)

    <div className="w-full flex justify-center items-center">


        import Image from "next/image";
      <Image
              src="https://assets.nicholasoxford.com/cfworker.webp"
              alt="Photo"
              width={500}
              height={500}
              object-fit="contain"
              priority
              className="next-image"
            />

          </div>
When promopted name your project. This command also defaults to pnpm

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --experimental-app --eslint --src-dir --import-alias --use-pnpm --typescript --tailwind
```

When promopted about app directory, response no.

```bash
Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? (No/Yes) No
```

Change directory into your project. If you named your project something other than `my-next-app` change the directory name to match.

```bash
cd my-next-app
```
