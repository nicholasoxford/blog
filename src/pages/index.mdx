## Introduction

My name is Nicholas Oxford.

I grew up in Atlanta and went to [Babson College](https://www.babson.edu/) and [Georgia State](https://www.gsu.edu/).

I am a software engineer living in Bozeman, Montana.

I currently work at [Primitives](https://primitives.xyz).

I used to work on the [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.com/) music team.

I've skied over 65 days this year, did a 200 mile bike ride, and just got engaged.
