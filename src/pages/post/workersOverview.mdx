When promopted name your project. This command also defaults to pnpm

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --experimental-app --eslint --src-dir --import-alias --use-pnpm --typescript --tailwind
```

When promopted about app directory, response no.

```bash
Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? (No/Yes) No
```

Change directory into your project. If you named your project something other than `my-next-app` change the directory name to match.

```bash
cd my-next-app
```
